          <h2 class="text">About Me</h2>
            <p class="text info">My name is Oswaldo Arevalo. I was born on July 18<sup>th</sup> 1986. I am 30 years of age and am an aspiring web developer.
              My end goal is to make this into my new career. I've come to know that the road to success is one
              that is always under construction, just as this page is. Although this is a basic layout and basic design
              I am glad that it is something I created. I first got into coding when a friend of mine suggested I give it a try. I first started out on a couple of websites where I can code for free.
              Soon as I typed my first <em>Hello World!</em> I knew this was something I wanted to do. Seeing how pages were built even if it was in the most basic way(similar to this one) was a satisfying feeling. I know that this will not come as easy as those websites make it out to be. I do know that this has to be done in my dreams while I sleep and in my day dreams while awake.
               I also know that this will be one of many more late nights or better yet,
              early mornings since I am going to be optimistic about it. One quote that stands out in my head when it comes to
              these early mornings is....<i>Never let the sun catch you sleeping</i>. I am quite excited for what the future holds
              for me in this new adventure. Whatever confusion and sleepless nights that may lay ahead of me I will be ready to face
              it with a double espresso and possibly a redbull or two.</p>
